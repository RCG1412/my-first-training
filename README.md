# About Markdown
## What is Markdown
Markdown is a very lightweight markup language that lets you create rich text (meaning text that has emphasis, headers, etc) in any plain text editor. Markdown, like HTML, allows you to specify text formatting, but it is far less expressive than HTML, which is perfectly fine since it is only meant to format text and not create full web pages.

The resulting Markdown you write is then fed in to a converter that replaces the Markdown syntax with HTML, which can then be displayed on a web page. In addition to the Markdown syntax, you can also write plain HTML as well, so if you have some more complicated structure you want to add in-line with your text, you'll still have the ability to do so.

## Markdown Syntax Examples
